\section*{ABSTRACT}
This study aims to formulate a mathematical rating system for Men's NCAA Division 1 basketball teams, facilitating their ranking and aiding in the completion of the March Madness tournament bracket. Our focus encompasses all season games leading up to the tournament, with a particular emphasis on the significance of recent games, considering them most influential due to observed team improvement. Notably, our methodology involves negating the impact of home team advantage, as the games are hosted on neutral territories. Additionally, we prioritize acknowledging the advantage held by teams with ongoing win streaks over those with low to zero streaks.

We examine the frequency of records in a series of real numbers, x1, x2, x3 · · · where
any xi maybe 1 with the probability of p and 0 with the probability of 1−p = q. A record
is, in this paper, defined as a streak of 1s that is longer than any of the previous streaks.
Formulas are deduced for the probability that the first record ends at any given index
and that any given nth record is of length l. Expected values are then calculated. These
formulas can be used to analyze if records in sequences are the results of randomness or
indicate underlying trends.

This project involves collaborative efforts within groups to design and implement a unique scheme for rating and ranking NCAA Division 1 men's college basketball teams based on the data from the 2023-2024 season. Participants will employ analytical methods and statistical approaches to calculate their team rankings, and subsequently utilize these rankings to complete an NCAA tournament bracket. The project culminates in a competition where the effectiveness of each group's rating scheme will be evaluated to determine the most successful methodology for predicting team performance in the tournament. Through this hands-on exercise, participants will gain practical experience in building and assessing ranking systems for collegiate sports, fostering a deeper understanding of the dynamics within NCAA Division 1 men's college basketball.

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}


\section{\textbf{Assumptions}}

In the evaluation process for March Madness teams, it is imperative to recognize that each game carries equal significance, as a single loss results in elimination for the teams involved. This equality in importance emphasizes the notion that games at the tournament's beginning should be weighed as heavily as those in the finals, preventing the need for recalculating ratings and rankings after each game. The limited practice time between matches underscores the importance of a team's current state as a reliable measure of its performance throughout the tournament. March Madness being held in neutral territories leads to the assumption of impartial and evenly distributed attendance for both teams, eliminating the influence of home or away distinctions. To further level the playing field, home team advantage is disregarded when calculating ratings and rankings, acknowledging that success in neutral territories is crucial for tournament advancement.

Moreover, the assumption extends to the disregard of game times within a tournament round, treating them as uniform and not requiring specific consideration. The collective skill level of individual players is presumed to be contained in the team ratings, emphasizing overall team proficiency rather than relying heavily on select players. This all-inclusive approach extends to the assumption of relatively comparable skill levels across conferences, with due consideration for the league's competitiveness where a longer win streak holds more significance.

In the January 2022 study titled "The Hot Hand in the Wild," authored by Wayne Winston, an operations researcher at Indiana University Bloomington, and Konstantinos Pelechrinis, a computer scientist at the University of Pittsburgh, compelling evidence emerges indicating that individual players can indeed demonstrate the hot hand to varying degrees. This suggests that players can consistently achieve a streak of successful shots beyond what would be expected by random chance. Moreover, it is commonly observed that teams with the most substantial win streaks often emerge as winners of their respective conferences, securing an assured spot in the tournament. This observation prompts our assumption that win streaks hold significance and should be considered in the process of rating and ranking the teams.

Drawing insights from Andy Wittry's article "Why losing streaks shouldn't matter when filling out your NCAA tournament bracket," the assumption is made that losing streaks are not a significant factor to consider. Teams entering the NCAA tournament on a losing streak are considered relatively rare, given the single-elimination nature of conference tournaments and the exclusion of teams on a losing streak that earned an automatic bid.

Additionally, when creating the tournament rating and ranking of teams, there is an assumption that early-season games hold less weight than more recent ones. This assumption is grounded in the belief that teams generally improve throughout the season due to consistent practice and increased strength, shaping the criteria for evaluating team performance leading up to March Madness.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\section{Conclusion}
 In conclusion, from the principal component analysis, it seems the paper features can best be studies using just a single linear combination (first principal component) which explains nearly all the variability (98.7\%) explained by the original paper variables. Also, from the Canonical Correlation analysis, it is observed that the first two canonical variates are good summary measures of the two sets of pulp fiber and paper variables. We were able to reduce the number of original variables from 4 to 2 pairs of canonical variables, this was due to the high canonical correlation values obtained, and the significance of the likelihood ratio statistics for the two canonical correlations. The first two canonical correlations explains 98.86\% of the between groups correlations.
